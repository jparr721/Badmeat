# Stor-Viewer v0.1.0 

## DEPRECATED
This code was a good open source learning experience for my friends and I, but it is now being built and maintained in a super secret repo for intellectual property and other hacking related reasons. The code will stay up as a reference, but it's probably not the best example for some things.

## Welcome to the Stor Viewer!

Stor-Viewer is a food management and e-pantry app that will allow you to quickly, and easily manage food purchases. Scan your receipt from any major grocery store and watch as your purchased items automatically populate into the list. Once your items are in the list, the app will automatically track their expiration date, and as it gets close to said date you will receive push alert warnings and recipe ideas with the expiring ingredients so none are wasted.

# Goals
