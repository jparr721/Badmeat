# Badmeat v0

## Welcome to Badmeat!

Badmeat is a food management and e-pantry app that will allow you to quickly, and easily manage food purchases. Scan your reciept from any major grocery store and watch as your purchased items automatically populate into the list. Once your items are in the list, the app will automagically track their expiration date, and as it gets close to said date you will recieve push alert warnings and recipe ideas with the expiring ingredients so none are wasted.

# Goals
- The app is going to be natively programmed to both of the main mobile operating systems (Android, iOS).


# TODO's
- [x] Set up github for team access
- [x] Create a template android project (hello world)
- [x] Have everyone pull the repo and successfully build the template app in their local IDE
- [x] Remove "hello world" implementation and create a simple core app (multiple blank screens + navigation)
- [ ] Push to repo; have team pull and build
- [ ] Team members begin to "sign up" for screens to develop
- [ ] Add components and mock elements

For developers: Please message the group before pushing changes to the master branch to make sure we can avoid merge conflicts.
